version 4 (Bitbucket-server). It is recommended to use the puppet-forge versions
and not the github master branch.

## Overview

This is a puppet module to install Atlassian Stash. On-premises source code
management for Git that's secure, fast, and enterprise grade.

|Module Version   | Support Stash versions  |
|-----------------|-------------------------|
| 1.3.0           | 3.0.0 - 3.9.2           |
| 2.0.0           | 3.9.2 - 4.x.x           |

## Module Description

This module installs/upgrades Atlassian's Enterprise source code management tool.
The Stash module also manages the stash configuration files with Puppet.

## Setup

### Stash Prerequisites

* Stash requires a Java Developers Kit (JDK) or Java Run-time Environment (JRE)
  platform to be installed on your server's operating system. Oracle JDK / JRE
  (formerly Sun JDK / JRE)  versions 7 and 8 and Open JDK/ JRE versions 7 and 8
  are currently supported by Atlassian.

* Stash requires a relational database to store its configuration data. This module
  currently supports PostgreSQL 8.4 to 9.x and MySQL 5.x. We suggest using
  puppetlabs-postgresql/puppetlabs-mysql modules to configure/manage the database.
  The module uses PostgreSQL as a default.

* Whilst not required, for production use we recommend using nginx/apache as a
  reverse proxy to Stash. We suggest using the jfryman/nginx puppet module.

### What Stash affects

If installing to an existing Stash instance, it is your responsibility to backup
your database. We also recommend that you backup your Stash home directory and
that you align your current Stash version with the version you intend to use with
puppet Stash module.

You must have your database setup with the account user that Stash will use.
This can be done using the puppetlabs-postgresql and puppetlabs-mysql modules.
The mysql java connector can be installed using the [puppet/mysql_java_connector](https://forge.puppetlabs.com/puppet/mysql_java_connector)
module.

When using this module to upgrade Stash, please make sure you have a database/Stash
home backup. We plan to include a class for backing up the stash home directory
in a future release.

When upgrading stash from < 3.8.0 to >= 3.8.0 puppet will notify the stash service
to restart for two puppet runs. This is because the stash upgrade makes file
attribute and content changes to the stash-config.properties. See issue #74

### Beginning with Stash

This puppet module will automatically download the Stash tar.gz from Atlassian and
extracts it into /opt/stash/atlassian-stash-$version. The default Stash home is /home/stash.

#### Basic examples

```puppet
  class { 'stash':
    javahome    => '/opt/java',
  }
```

```puppet
  class { 'stash':
    version        => '3.3.0',
    javahome       => '/opt/java',
    dburl          => 'jdbc:postgresql://stash.example.com:5433/stash',
    dbpassword     => $stashpass,
  }
```

Schedule a weekly git garbage collect for all repositories.

```puppet
  class { 'stash::gc': }
```

Enable external facts for stash version.

```puppet
  class { 'stash::facts': }
```

Enable a stash backup

```puppet
  class { 'stash':
    backup_ensure          => present,
    backupclient_version    => '1.6.0',
    backup_home            => '/opt/stash-backup',
    backupuser             => 'admin',
    backuppass             => 'password',
    backup_keep_age        => '3d',
    backup_schedule_hour   => '5',
    backup_schedule_minute => '0',
  }
```

##### Upgrades

###### Upgrades to Stash

Stash can be upgraded by incrementing this version number. This will *STOP* the
running instance of Stash and attempt to upgrade. You should take caution when
doing large version upgrades. Always backup your database and your home directory.
The stash::facts class is required for upgrades.

```puppet
  class { 'stash':
    javahome => '/opt/java',
    version  => '3.4.0',
  }
  class { 'stash::facts': }
```

If the stash service is managed outside of puppet the stop_stash paramater can
be used to shut down stash.

```puppet
  class { 'stash':
    javahome   => '/opt/java',
    version    => '3.4.0',
    stop_stash => 'crm resource stop stash && sleep 15',
  }
  class { 'stash::facts': }
```

## Usage

This module also allows for direct customization of the JVM, following
[Atlassian's recommendations](https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Setting+Properties+and+Options+on+Startup)

This is especially useful for setting properties such as HTTP/https proxy settings.
Support has also been added for reverse proxying stash via Apache or nginx.

### A more complex example

```puppet
  class { 'stash':
    version        => '2.2.0',
    installdir     => '/opt/atlassian/atlassian-stash',
    homedir        => '/opt/atlassian/application-data/stash-home',
    javahome       => '/opt/java',
    download_url    => 'http://example.co.za/pub/software/development-tools/atlassian/',
    dburl          => 'jdbc:postgresql://dbvip.example.co.za:5433/stash',
    dbpassword     => $stashpass,
    service_manage => false,
    jvm_xms        => '1G',
    jvm_xmx        => '4G',
    java_opts      => '-Dhttp.proxyHost=proxy.example.co.za -Dhttp.proxyPort=8080 -Dhttps.proxyHost=proxy.example.co.za -Dhttps.proxyPort=8080 -Dhttp.nonProxyHosts=\"localhost|127.0.0.1|172.*.*.*|10.*.*.*|*.example.co.za\"',
    proxy          => {
      scheme       => 'https',
      proxyName    => 'stash.example.co.za',
      proxyPort    => '443',
    },
    tomcat_port    => '7991'
  }
  class { 'stash::facts': }
  class { 'stash::gc': }
```

### A Hiera example

This example is used in production for 500 users in an traditional enterprise
environment. Your mileage may vary. The dbpassword can be stored using eyaml
hiera extension.

```yaml
# Stash configuration
stash::version:        '3.4.0'
stash::installdir:     '/opt/atlassian/atlassian-stash'
stash::homedir:        '/opt/atlassian/application-data/stash-home'
stash::javahome:       '/opt/java'
stash::dburl:          'jdbc:postgresql://dbvip.example.co.za:5433/stash'
stash::service_manage: false
stash::download_url:    'http://example.co.za/pub/software/development-tools/atlassian'
stash::jvm_xms:        '1G'
stash::jvm_xmx:        '4G'
stash::java_opts: >
  -XX:+UseLargePages
  -Dhttp.proxyHost=proxy.example.co.za
  -Dhttp.proxyPort=8080
  -Dhttps.proxyHost=proxy.example.co.za
  -Dhttps.proxyPort=8080
  -Dhttp.nonProxyHosts=localhost\|127.0.0.1\|172.*.*.*\|10.*.*.*\|*.example.co.za
stash::env:
  - 'http_proxy=proxy.example.co.za:8080'
  - 'https_proxy=proxy.example.co.za:8080'
stash::proxy:
  scheme:     'https'
  proxyName:  'stash.example.co.za'
  proxyPort:  '443'
stash::stash_stop: '/usr/sbin crm resource stop stash'
```
