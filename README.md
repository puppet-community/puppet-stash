##Overview

This is a puppet module to install Atlassian Stash. On-premises source code management for Git that's secure, fast, and enterprise grade.

##Module Description

This module installs/upgrades Atlassian's Enterprise source code management tool. The Stash module also manages the stash configuration files with Puppet. 

##Setup
<a name="Stash-prerequisites">
###Stash Prerequisites
* Stash requires a Java Developers Kit (JDK) or Java Run-time Environment (JRE) platform to be installed on your server's operating system. Oracle JDK / JRE (formerly Sun JDK / JRE)  versions 7 and 8 and Open JDK/ JRE versions 7 and 8 are currently supported by Atlassian.

* Stash requires a relational database to store its configuration data. This module currently supports PostgreSQL 8.4 to 9.x and MySQL 5.x. We suggest using puppetlabs-postgresql/puppetlabs-mysql modules to configure/manage the database. The module uses PostgreSQL as a default.

* Whilst not required, for production use we recommend using nginx/apache as a reverse proxy to Stash. We suggest using the jfryman/nginx puppet module.

###What Stash affects
If installing to an existing Stash instance, it is your responsibility to backup your database. We also recommend that you backup your Stash home directory and that you align your current Stash version with the version you intend to use with puppet Stash module.

You must have your database setup with the account user that Stash will use. This can be done using the puppetlabs-postgresql and puppetlabs-mysql modules.

When using this module to upgrade Stash, please make sure you have a database/Stash home backup. We plan to include a class for backing up the stash home directory in a future release.

As RHEL 6 and its derivatives do not include a version of git that will work by default with stash. We enable the repoforge module as a default if it is not already enabled. Whilst this is not best practice, it is better than the module not working for inexperienced users. By default we will upgrade git if it is already installed and the repoforge repository is not enabled. Default: true. You can turn all this functionality off with 'repoforge => false' and manage git outside of the module.
	
###Beginning with Stash
This puppet module will automatically download the Stash tar.gz from Atlassian and extracts it into /opt/stash/atlassian-stash-$version. The default Stash home is /home/stash.

#####Basic examples
```puppet
  class { 'stash':
    javahome    => '/opt/java',
  }
```

```puppet
  class { 'stash':
    version        => '3.3.0',
    javahome       => '/opt/java',
    dburl          => 'jdbc:postgresql://stash.example.com:5433/stash',
    dbpassword     => $stashpass,
  }
```
Schedule a weekly git garbage collect for all repositories.
```puppet
  class { 'stash::gc': }
```
Enable external facts for stash version.
```puppet
  class { 'stash::facts': }
```
Enable a stash backup
```puppet
  class { 'stash':
    backup_ensure       => present,
    backupclientVersion => '1.6.0',
    backup_home         => '/opt/stash-backup',
    backupuser          => 'admin',
    backuppass          => 'password',
  }
```

A complete example with postgres/nginx/stash is available [here](https://github.com/mkrakowitzer/vagrant-puppet-stash/blob/master/manifests/site.pp) or in the examples directory.
<a name="upgrades">
#####Upgrades

######Upgrades to Stash

Stash can be upgraded by incrementing this version number. This will *STOP* the running instance of Stash and attempt to upgrade. You should take caution when doing large version upgrades. Always backup your database and your home directory. The stash::facts class is required for upgrades.

```puppet
  class { 'stash':
    javahome => '/opt/java',
    version  => '3.4.0',
  }
  class { 'stash::facts': }
```
If the stash service is managed outside of puppet the stop_stash paramater can be used to shut down stash.
```puppet
  class { 'stash':
    javahome   => '/opt/java',
    version    => '3.4.0',
    stop_stash => 'crm resource stop stash && sleep 15',
  }
  class { 'stash::facts': }
```
######Upgrades to the Stash puppet Module
mkrakowitzer-deploy has been replaced with nanliu-staging as the default module for deploying the Stash binaries. You can still use mkrakowitzer-deploy with the *staging_or_deploy => 'deploy'*. nanliu-staging can not cleanup after itself, you may need to prune your /opt/staging directory if you upgrade often.

```puppet
  class { 'stash':
    javahome          => '/opt/java',
    staging_or_deploy => 'deploy',
  }
```

##Usage

This module also allows for direct customization of the JVM, following [Atlassian's recommendations](https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Setting+Properties+and+Options+on+Startup)

This is especially useful for setting properties such as HTTP/https proxy settings. Support has also been added for reverse proxying stash via Apache or nginx.

####A more complex example

```puppet
  class { 'stash':
    version        => '2.2.0',
    installdir     => '/opt/atlassian/atlassian-stash',
    homedir        => '/opt/atlassian/application-data/stash-home',
    javahome       => '/opt/java',
    downloadURL    => 'http://example.co.za/pub/software/development-tools/atlassian/',
    dburl          => 'jdbc:postgresql://dbvip.example.co.za:5433/stash',
    dbpassword     => $stashpass,
    service_manage => false,
    jvm_xms        => '1G',
    jvm_xmx        => '4G',
    java_opts      => '-Dhttp.proxyHost=proxy.example.co.za -Dhttp.proxyPort=8080 -Dhttps.proxyHost=proxy.example.co.za -Dhttps.proxyPort=8080 -Dhttp.nonProxyHosts=\"localhost|127.0.0.1|172.*.*.*|10.*.*.*|*.example.co.za\"',
    proxy          => {
      scheme       => 'https',
      proxyName    => 'stash.example.co.za',
      proxyPort    => '443',
    },
    staging_or_deploy => 'deploy',
  }
  class { 'stash::facts': }
  class { 'stash::gc': }
```

### A Hiera example 

This example is used in production for 500 users in an traditional enterprise environment. Your mileage may vary. The dbpassword can be stored using eyaml hiera extension.

```yaml

stash::dburl:          'jdbc:postgresql://dbvip.example.co.za:5433/stash'
stash::service_manage: false
stash::downloadURL:    'http://example.co.za/pub/software/development-tools/atlassian'
stash::jvm_xms:        '1G'

```
